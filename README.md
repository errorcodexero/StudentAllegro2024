### Whats different about this?

Most obviously, this codebase is written solely by students.

That is not the only change however, for this codebase we are moving to the
[WPILIB command-based](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/index.html) robot framework, and experimenting with
[AdvantageKit](https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageKit) and [AdvantageScope](https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageScope), Mechanical Advantage's logging framework and telemetry application.
